### 🔥 About Me

🌟 My goal is to contribute to innovative and impactful projects where I can apply my academic knowledge in software development.
I am passionate about transforming ideas into functional, user-centered solutions. Through my studies and personal projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience with modern technologies, and I’m eager to continue expanding my technical expertise. I’m particularly motivated by environments that encourage creativity, problem-solving, and continuous improvement. My objective is to grow professionally by taking on real-world challenges and contributing meaningfully to the success of the teams I work with.

💼 I am able to work independently or collaboratively within a team, and I’m highly motivated by continuous learning and the refinement of my skills.
I thrive in dynamic settings where I can analyze problems, propose solutions, and adapt quickly. Whether working alone or with others, I prioritize clear communication, organization, and commitment to delivering high-quality results. I enjoy collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, sharing knowledge, and learning from diverse perspectives. My enthusiasm for technology pushes me to constantly explore new tools, frameworks, and best practices to stay up-to-date in a fast-evolving field.

🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter and Kotlin to expand my expertise in cross-platform and mobile development.
I’m exploring how to build intuitive, performant, and scalable mobile applications while understanding key concepts such as state management, UI/UX principles, and API integration. This learning path allows me to strengthen my mobile development skills and gain the ability to create applications that run seamlessly on both Android and iOS. I enjoy experimenting with new features, building small applications, and integrating real-time functionalities to enhance my understanding.
